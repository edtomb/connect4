The childhood classic! This human-vs AI connect 4 game uses a variable-depth minimax algorithm and is gauranteed to make you angry when you lose to it:

Q: How good is it? 

A: currently the bot is not optimized to solve the game completely. Also, it does not try to look at all 1.6 âˆ— 10^13 possible positions on the 7x6 board, the bot searches a hard max of 1.5 million moves. There is also a search depth slider to control the bots computational power. 

Pls try it tho I put a lot of effort into it.
